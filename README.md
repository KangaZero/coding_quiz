**What?**

This is a quiz made with interactive features thanks to the integration of Javascript. This quiz consists of two webpages, one for the quiz, and another to show the user's scores as a result of taking the quiz. 

The quiz consists of 5 questions with four options in a multiple-choice question setup.

The user is given a total of 60 seconds to complete the quiz. However if the user picks a wrong option, they will be penalised with a reduction of 5 seconds taken off the timer, along with a score reduction of 1 point. 
If the right option is picked, they will be rewarded with 1 point. Thus, the user can accumalat

**Acquired Knowledge**

- Understanding in how to navigate to get a specific value within an array
- A lot of practice of querySelector and createElement method
- Some understanding of "event" 
- Additional methods learnt outside of class such linking into a new page, or reloading a page using Javascript
- Some practice on setInterval and clearInterval
- Debugging practice using chrome's dev tools
- A better understanding of JSON, and localStorage

In addition to these links, I would like to acknowledge and credit the help I had from a tutor in a one-on-one session. They have helped me in debugging my code, and allowing the options to show the proper text, and for event.target to recognise the boolean (but as a string), allowing my quiz to work. 

Here are their contact details:

And small shout out to one of the TAs, Doug for fixing a small error for my localStorage function.
